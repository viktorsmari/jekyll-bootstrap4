## Jekyll with Bootstrap 4

The goal is to provide a basic simple Jekyll with Bootstrap 4, almost like a 'no theme' setup.

This was based on Jekyll's default **minima** theme but removed most of it parts.

Now it only includes 3 layouts, (default, page, post) and 3 plugins (feed, sitemap, seo).

### Usage
1. Clone or fork
2. Edit `_config.yml` with your site information.
